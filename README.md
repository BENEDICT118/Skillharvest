# How to make a visual report using a pivot table 
## project overview 
A pivot table is a data summarization tool often used in spreadsheet programs like Excel or Google Sheets. It helps analyze, explore, and summarize large sets of data by automatically sorting, counting, and averaging the data, offering insights into patterns and trends. Here's a general project overview for working with a pivot table:

### Objective 
The main objective is to organize, summarize, and analyze large datasets using pivot tables. By the end of the project, you should have a clear understanding of how to generate insights, visualize key metrics, and explore relationships between data points.

### Data source
my data was gotten from premises
### Tools used
The tool i used was Microsoft 365
### Exploratory data analysis 
I want to check for the sum of the unit sold for the whole region.

### Procedure/Step by step
After downloading the  data which you want to use, you will have to open it on your excel sheet or Microsoft365 depending on which ever one you are using 
- You will have to highlight the whole data by pressing Ctrl+shift+forward ðŸ‘‰arrow and then press the downward ðŸ‘‡ arrow

- After the data has been highlighted we go to the menu bar and click on insert, and then click on the pivot table.
- After clicking on the pivot table after which you will see an image

we click on the new worksheet and then Press ok. This will then take us to a new worksheet.
This new worksheet that has been created is where we start making use of our highlighted data to start creating our own pivot table.

- By the righthand side of our screen we will see our Field list from which from which will we choose the data we want to make use of. Let say for instance we want to see the region with the sum of unit sold.
- Next we select/drag the region to the row pivot table area and then select/drag the the unit sold ro the value pivot table area.

- next we highlight the whole table and then under the menu bar which are the toolbar we look for the chart section and then click on column bar, bar chart, pie chart, line chart depending on which ever you want to work with. let say we want to work with column bar

- Beside your column chart you will see three icons which are
1. chart element
2. chart style
3. format chart area.

These three items are tools you will be needing in order to create your desire chart base on what you want.

Under the chart elements these are where you can add or remove features such as your chart title, data label, gridlines, legend and so on.

while for your chart style is where you can change the chart style and also add or change the colour of your chart.

finally the format chart area is where you add effect such as shadow, glow, soft edges and so on.

### Recommendations 
- Rows and Columns: These fields help to group and categorize the data. For example, placing "Product Name" in the Rows area will create a list of products.
- Values:This is where you place numerical data for analysis (e.g., sales, costs). Choose how you want to summarize the data (sum, average, count, etc.).
- Keep the table manageable by not overloading it with too many fields. If it becomes too complex, it may be difficult to interpret or visualize the results.
- Break down complex data into smaller, more meaningful tables or use charts for a visual representation.
